# Family Life
One of the most important aspects of my life has been my large family. Below is a list of all my siblings who made my life **interesting** to say the least.
* Lindsay McChesney.    
-Lindsay is my oldest sibling. We became close in recent years, but with our 8 year age gap, we weren't always the best of friends. Nowadays, Lindsay works in software developement at a company called [Ninja](https://www.ninjarmm.com/). Her and her husband, Cameron McChesney, have three cats, two chinchillas, and a new golden retriever puppy.   
* Michael Beisheim.  
-Michael is the brainiest of the bunch. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 2018 with a degree in Industrial and Operations Engineering. He now works in New York City and works as a day trader.    
* Ben Beisheim.   
-Ben has been my most consistent friend throughout childhood. Being the closest to me in age, only three years older than I, we spent a lot of time together. While this time was not spent without lots of brotherly bullying, I always knew he was someone who cared for me. Nowadays, he works at a restaurant in downtown NYC and lives with Michael.
