# Pets
I _love_ animals. Always have, always will. Here are the pets I have currently:

## Columbia Kitties

Above we see my two babies I have down here in Columbia, Honey (orange) and Cleo (black with the cone of shame). They are a fiesty duo.

## Hometown Homies

Here we have my kitty I have at home, Annabelle, as well as my puppy who unfortunately passed away this past week, Daisy.
